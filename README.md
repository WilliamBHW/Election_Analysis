# Election_Analysis

## Project Overview
A Colorado Board of Elections employee has given you the following tasks to complete the election audit of a recent local congressional election.

1. Calculate the toal number of votes cast.
2. Get a complete list of candidates who recieved votes.
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate recieved.
4. calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
5. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.
6. Calculate voter turnout for each county.
7. Calculate the percentages of votes from each county.
8. Determine the largest county based on turnout.

## Resourcces
- Data Source: election_results.csv
- Software: Python 3.8.2, Visual Studio Code 1.58.2

## Analysis and Challenges
In this project, the final python cript will be expected to deliver the following information after a complete run:

1. The total number of votes cast.
2. A complete list of candidates who recieved votes.
3. A complete list of county where voters turout.
4. The percentage of vote each candidate won.
5. The percentage of turnout each county has.
6. The total number of votes each candidate won.
7. The total number of turnout each county have.
8. The county which has most turnout.

### Challenge Data Background
> After giving you an overview of the election audit tasks, Tom wants to go over the steps required in detail. He's going to show you a technique commonly used by programmers to write steps of their code, which is called pseudocode. Pseudocode will make the audit easier to present to nontechnical colleagues and stakeholders.

To facilitate the design process, programmers use pseudocode to create models or flowcharts for their programs. Pseudocode is like a roadmap of what you think your code will look like or the steps you'll take to complete the task at hand.

Pseudo means "fake," so pseudocode is essentially fake code. Pseudocode is an informal language that has no syntax rules and is not meant to be executed. The point of using pseudocode is to focus on the overall design of the program.
